# [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 
Tag Line: From Research to Production
An open source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment.

Best thing: Python first â€“ Deep integration into Python allows popular libraries and packages to be used for easily writing neural network layers in Python.
There is also a Hybrid Front-End, Distributed Training, Tools & Libraries (supporting computer vision, NLP)

There are cloud deep learning VM images through GCP, AWS and Azure 

PyTorch provide training images, cheatsheets and support through Slack, GitHub and forum.
