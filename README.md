## Practical Deep Learning For Coders Part 1
### 2018 edition of fast.ai's 7 week course, Practical Deep Learning For Coders Part 1, taught by Jeremy Howard (Kaggle's #1 competitor 2 years running, and founder of Enlitic).
 
https://course.fast.ai/
 
This 7-week course is designed for anyone with at least a year of coding experience, and some memory of high-school math. You will start with step one—learning how to get a GPU server online suitable for deep learning—and go all the way through to creating state of the art, highly practical, models for computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. There are around 20 hours of lessons, and you should plan to spend around 10 hours a week for 7 weeks to complete the material.
 
YOU WILL LEARN HOW TO:<br>
- Set up your own GPU server in the cloud
- Use the fastai and Pytorch libraries in python to train and run deep learning models
- Build, debug, and visualize a state of the art convolutional neural network (CNN) for recognizing images
- Build state of the art recommendation systems using neural-network based collaborative filtering
- Build state of the art time series and structured data models using categorical embeddings
- Get great results even from small datasets, by using transfer learning
- Understand the components of a neural network, including activation functions, dense and convolutional layers, and optimizers
- Build, debug, and visualize a recurrent neural network (RNN) for natural language processing (NLP), including developing a sentiment classifier which beat all previous academic benchmarks.
- Recognize and deal with over-fitting, by using data augmentation, dropout, batch normalization, and similar techniques

### managing the fastai project
I will add issues to keep track of the tasks completed as part of the fastai course.


## Machine Learning with Fast AI 
Learn the most important machine learning models, including how to create them yourself from scratch, as well as key skills in data preparation, model validation, and building data products.

There are around 24 hours of lessons
