See issues open and closed for notes on all fastai work. Issues are used to task work and record solutions throughout the course. Below is a summary of the fastai deep learning experience from December 2018 to May 2019.

## Practical Deep Learning For Coders Part 1 v3
Created/Taught by Jeremy Howard, Rachel Thomas and team @ [USFCA](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute)

# 0. Set-up cloud computing
I decided to use Google Cloud Platform compute with Â£230.58 free credit for 1 year. [This is a wonderful tutorial](https://course.fast.ai/start_gcp.html) to get started and refer back to. 
My notes are [here](https://github.com/datalass1/fastai/issues/18)

# 1. Learn how to transfer data and notebooks to and from Google Cloud Platform instance
It should look something like this: `gcloud compute scp jupyter@my-fastai-instance:~/tutorials/fastai/course-v3/nbs/dl1/lesson1v3-pets-20190131.ipynb ~/git/fastai/dl1/`
