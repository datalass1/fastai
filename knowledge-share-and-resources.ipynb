    "### What is a convolution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions (f and g) to produce a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a neural network?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **biological neural network**: neurons interconnected by synapses to carry out a specific function when activated. Neural circuits interconnect to one another to form large scale brain networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or an **artificial neural network**, for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems; an interconnected group of artificial neurons that uses a mathematical or computational model for information processing based on a connectionistic approach to computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In more practical terms artificial neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling or decision making tools. They can be used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an image kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "An image kernel is a small matrix. Check out this useful [interactive visualisation.](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a learning rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic concept of LR = how quickly we will zoom onto the solution; how quickly or how slowly you want to update the weights or parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are matrix multiplications?\n",
    "\n",
    "[See this animation](http://matrixmultiplication.xyz/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is gradient descent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at a really cool project by [José Fernández Portal plotting the loss function and the path followed by SGD](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/joshfp/85d96f07aaa5f4d2c9eb47956ccdcc88/lesson2-sgd-in-action.ipynb), notebook added to [datalass1 GitHub for reference](https://github.com/datalass1/fastai/blob/master/dl1/amazing-nbs/lesson2-sgd-in-action.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a tensor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are similar to NumPy’s ndarrays, with the addition being that Tensors can also be used on a GPU to accelerate computing.\n"
